### Exercise 1 a

Implement a program that threshold an input image with a certain `value`.
The pixel in the output image will have a value of `255` if it have a value
greater or equal to the threshold in the input, and `0` otherwise.

The execution is:

> exercise-1a input-image.pgm value output-image.pgm

### Exercise 1 b
 
Implement a program that compares if two images given by parameter are equal.
In which case, the program should print `=`, and if they are different they
should print `!=`.

The execution is:
 
> exercise-1b image-1.pgm image-2.pgm

### Exercise 1 d

Implement a program that computes the infimun and supremum of two images.

The execution is:

> exercise-1d-sup input-image-1.pgm input-image-2.pgm output-image.pgm
> exercise-1d-inf input-image-1.pgm input-image-2.pgm output-image.pgm
